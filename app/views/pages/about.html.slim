    I love knitting both because of its complexity and simplicity. I adore the simplicity of stockinette stitch and the soothing nature of garter stitch. I look forward to knitting inch after inch of garter stitch, adding texture, cables, and lace to add flair to my project. When I'm having a stressful day and need to zone out, I turn to complicated lace, mind-bending cables, and tedious color work. While I may whine and moan about how much I hate color work, or how much I hate working nupps, at the end of the day, I love everything about knitting.

    It's for beginning knitters to challenge themselves to learn new things, and it's for advanced knitters who want to work with easily customizable patterns.

    It's for me. Because I forgot how much I really, truly love knitting.
