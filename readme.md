Everyone loves automated testing:

Once upon a time there was a girl (a woman, really) who decided to attend Dev Bootcamp. It was her dream that when she finished Dev Bootcamp, she could build a knitting pattern generator.

She fulfilled that dream quite a bit before she finished Dev Bootcamp, and she built a small knitting pattern generator using [Sinatra](https://github.com/feministy/knithat), but she never deployed it.

She decided one day that she would port that little baby app over to Rails and give it full-blown functionality.

This app, as with all great pieces of code (although I wouldn't call this great - yet), is a work in progress. It celebrates my love of simple knits and Ruby, with a little bit of JavaScript thrown in.

Not deployed to the web yet, but it will be soon!
